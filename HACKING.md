GitHub Workflow

TLDR:
Fork the joystream repo (upstream), clone the (origin) forked repo locally. Setup upstream repmote. Create new feature branch based off upstream development branch. Push new feature to origin. Create a pull request targeting the upstream development branch.

TODO detailed instructions:
fork,
clone
setup remotes
checkout upstream/development
checkout new-feature
