To get started with this example code:

    run `make` in `protos/` directory

This will generate the C++ grpc and protocol buffers code

    Build the daemon project in Qt and run the daemon executable

Install the npm modules `grpc`

```
$ npm install grpc
```

You can run the client `nodejs/main.js` to test the daemon
